## Sample PHP Zend code - for an Order Provisioner

This folder contains three PHP code samples from a larger project.  The overall Zend project setup files have been omitted, so this example will not run properly if executed.  It is merely an example of production-quality code written by myself in 2013.

The main (executable) file:  ProcessOrderRecords.php  requires two supporting library files:  LockFile.php and Functions.php

The LockFile.php was largely created from publicly-available industry-standard code found on the internet.
